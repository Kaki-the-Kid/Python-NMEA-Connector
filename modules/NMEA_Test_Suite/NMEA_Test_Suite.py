    * Here are some observations:
    * Notice the complete cycle shows an update interval of 2 seconds which is caused
    * by the fact that there is too much data to fit in one second at 4800 b/s.
    * Upping the b/s rate to 9600 will cause an update every second.
    *
    * Notice that the samples are in real time for each sentence because the GGA sentence
    * shows an update in the time of 1 second.
    *
    * It would be possible to provide update data every second by parsing more sentences
    * since the data is adjusted every second.
    *
    * Notice the gaps in the GSA message where the satellites in use are shown in a
    * there slots as compared to the GSV locations.Some tools do not decode this
    * configuration correctly.
    *
    * Note the GGA sentence starts the sequence every two seconds.
    *
    * This sample is similar for other Garmin receivers designed in the same time
    * frame as the G-12.
