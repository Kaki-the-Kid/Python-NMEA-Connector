# @brief    GNSS Satellite Fault Detection
# @param    <1> UTC of position fix
#           This sentence is used to support Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). 
#           Given that a GNSS receiver is tracking enough satellites to perform integrity checks 
#           of the positioning quality of the position solution a sentence is needed to report 
#           the output of this process to other systems to advise the system user. With the RAIM 
#           in the GNSS receiver, the receiver can isolate faults to individual satellites and not
#           use them in its position and velocity calculations.Also, the GNSS receiver can still 
#           track the satellite and easily judge when it is back within tolerance.This sentence 
#           shall be used for reporting this RAIM information. To perform this integrity function, 
#           the GNSS receiver must have at least two observables in addition to the minimum required 
#           for navigation.Normally these observables take the form of additional
#           redundant satellites.
# @param    If only GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BDS, QZSS, NavIC (IRNSS) is used for the reported position 
#           solution the talker ID is GP, GL, GA, GB, GQ, GI respectively and the errors pertain to 
#           the individual system.If satellites from multiple systems are used to obtain the reported 
#           position solution the talker ID is GN and the errors pertain to the combined solution.

        # Satellite ID numbers. To avoid possible confusion caused by repetition of satellite ID numbers when using
        # multiple satellite systems, the following convention has been adopted: 
        # <ul>
        # <li>a) GPS satellites are identified by their PRN numbers, which range from 1 to 32.</li>
        # <li>b) The numbers 33-64 are reserved for SBAS satellites. The SBAS system PRN numbers are 120-138.
        # The offset from NMEA SBAS SV ID to SBAS PRN number is 87. A SBAS PRN number of 120
        # minus 87 yields the SV ID of 33. The addition of 87 to the SV ID yields the SBAS PRN number.</li>
        # <li>c) The numbers 65-96 are reserved for GLONASS satellites. GLONASS satellites are identified by
        # 64+satellite slot number.The slot numbers are 1 through 24 for the full GLONASS constellation
        # of 24 satellites, this gives a range of 65 through 88. The numbers 89 through 96 are available if
        # slot numbers above 24 are allocated to on-orbit spares.
