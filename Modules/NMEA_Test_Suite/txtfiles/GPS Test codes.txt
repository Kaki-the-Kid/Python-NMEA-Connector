This application can send NMEA 0183 version 2.30 sentences through a Serial Device with default 4800 baud according to the NMEA specification. It may be
needed to scroll down in the list of usable items, to find the desired Serial Device. This depends on the configuration of the computer
The NMEA sentences that can be choosen to send is RMC. GGA. GU., GSA, VTG, ZDA and a custom-made
Additional NMEA sentences will be added later
GPS-Simulator can be used by technicians from RDN to simulate the NMEA output from the Mil GPS
GGA example: $GPGGA, 123519.4807.038,N,01131.000,E. 1,08,0.9,20,M,47,M,.*47
RMC example: $GPRMC.123519.A.4807.038,N,01131.000,E,022.4,084.4,230994,003.1,W,A *6A
Gll example: $GPGLL.5601.7919,N, 1116.972,E,212436.39,A,A*6C
GSA example: $GPGSA.A.3, 17, 15, 19,24,32, 10, 12.25,..,, 1.77, 1.00, 1.46*09
VTG example: $GPVTG,36.4,T.36.4,M, 1.00,N, 1.85,K*4E
ZDA example: $GPZDA.072727.68,02, 12,2019,00,00, *48
Custom: Copy/Paste, or manually write, a NMEA-sentence in the box to be send
The area that show the sentences that have been sent will be reset for every 50 repeatations to avoid overflow of the TextBlock
If too many sentences are chosen and repetition period is too small compared to the baud rate, the sentences doesn't have time to be sent before a new
update is called.This can confuse the serial device and the program can suddently stop.
Magnetic course is set to the same as true course
Some parametres of the NMEA entences are fixed That is for the moment Fixed Quality = 1 Number of satellites being tracked = 8: Horizontal dilution of
position = 0; Altitude in meters =20; Height of geoid in meters = O; Magnetic Variation = 0; GSA sentence is  atwaÂ¥S fixed

In setup it is possible to change the baud rate from 4800 (default) to 9600 or 38400
